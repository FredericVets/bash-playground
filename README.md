# bash-playground
Playground for bash. Diverse set of scripts. 
The backup directory contains a script to ease the creation of backups (see backup/backup-my-stuff for more info). 
What needs to be backuped / ignored is to be specified in the separate .config files. The result of the backup will be a tar.gz file.
